# BBS_Summaries
Summarizing output from bbsBayes into CWS content to publish on Web.

Includes these outputs:
long- and short-term trends for all species and regions
long- and short-term annual indices for all species and regions
map images to document relevant areas for each trend estimate
end-point trends
GAM-end-point trends
slope-based trends
COSEWIC-trend threshold assessments for all trends
Coverage calculations imported from 2017 analysis
probability of population change categories


# Notes on species complexes:

Previously, the Canadian BBS estimates have split and/or lumped species data for some species complexes.
However, this lumping and splitting process is complicated and arguably, is best done by the main BBS database managers. For some of these complexes, the database has been adjusted to lump or split complexes based on geography. 

For the 2018 version, I have followed the taxonomy in the main BBS dataset. So that estimates derived from the BBS database align for a given species definition. 

As a result for the following 7 species complexes, combined estimates are no longer produced (only species-specific estimates are provided).

 * Sapsuckers 
 * Traill's Flycatcher (see following note)
 * Western Flycatcher 
 * Solitary Vireo 
 * Northern Oriole 
 * Blue Grouse 
 * Western/Clark's Grebe (see following note)
 
## Alternate Start Dates for some of the individual species

The individual species in two of these species complexes cannot be reliably separated in the BBS database in the years before they were split. Therefore for the following 4 species their estimates only extend back to 5 years after they were split (to remove the effect of BBS observers learning to distinguish the two species soon after the split)
 
 * Alder and Willow Flycatcher, estimates start in 1978 (split in 1973)
 * Western and Clark's Grebe, estimates start in 1990 (split in 1985)
